Description: POSIX-compliant shell optimized for performance
 posish is a clean-room implementation of a POSIX shell, designed to be
 significantly faster than standard shells like dash or bash for scripting
 tasks. It features a custom buffered output system, optimized variable
 handling, and fast-path execution for builtins.
